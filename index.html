                        In this activity, I was asked to choose either a family member or a friend to present in a short
                        video using my webcam. The purpose was to practice speaking in English by describing personal
                        characteristics such as age, nationality, place of residence, hobbies, and relevant information
                        about daily activities.

                    <p>
                        For my presentation, I chose my brother, <strong>Gonzalo Antonio Sepúlveda Duarte</strong>, and
                        in the following video, I introduce him as part of this assignment.

                    <h3>Evidence GA2-240202501-AA1-EV02 – Virtual Job Interview Video</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this activity, I had to record a virtual interview with the support of one of my classmates.
                        The task consisted of simulating a job interview for a position related to my professional
                        profile. First, I participated as the applicant, and then we switched roles so that I could also
                        act as the interviewer.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>During the interview, I was required to answer the following questions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔️Tell us about yourself.</li>
                        <li>✔️What motivates you?</li>
                        <li>✔️What are your hobbies?</li>
                        <li>✔️What are your future plans if you get this job?</li>
                        <li>✔️What are your future goals or what are your career goals?</li>
                        <li>✔️What do you see as a major success in your life?</li>
                        <li>✔️Why did you leave your last job?</li>
                        <li>✔️Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This exercise was very useful to practice job-related vocabulary, improve fluency in answering
                        professional questions, and gain confidence in expressing myself in English during a job
                        interview context.

                    <p>
                        In this activity, I had to create an audio recording in English describing my academic and
                        professional journey. The task also included explaining my plans, actions, and possible future
                        solutions in relation to my academic and work context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This exercise helped me practice vocabulary for personal and professional settings.

                        In this activity, I had to design a brochure in English describing the information and main
                        characteristics of my training program. To complete the task, I used the digital tool Canva,
                        which
                        allowed me to work creatively and organize the content in a visually attractive way.

                    <p>
                        This activity was very useful to combine creativity with language learning, as it helped me
                        practice
                        writing in English while presenting academic information in a professional format.

                        In this activity, I had to write an email in English to apply for a job position. The task
                        required including relevant information from my résumé, using proper netiquette, and following a
                        formal structure.

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>
                    Learning vocabulary about crime and punishment is very useful because it not only helps us
                    understand
                    news, movies, and books, but also gives us the right words to describe situations related to the
                    law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin with, the word crime means an illegal activity, such as murder or robbery. On the other
                    hand,
                    punishment refers to the penalty a person receives when found guilty, like paying a fine or going to
                    prison. These terms are fundamental when talking about justice.
                </p>
                <h3>There are many types of crimes, each with specific vocabulary. For example:</h3>
                <ul class="examples-list">
                    <li><strong>Armed robbery:</strong> “The thief committed an armed robbery at the bank.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> “The company lost millions because of financial fraud.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Domestic violence:</strong> “The police arrested a man for domestic violence.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Vandalism:</strong> “Teenagers were punished for vandalism after painting graffiti on
                        public walls.”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This shows how each word describes a different illegal action.</p>

                <h3>The vocabulary of punishments is equally important. Some examples are:</h3>
                <p></p>
                <ul class="examples-list">
                    <li><strong>Fine:</strong> “He had to pay a fine for speeding.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Community service:</strong> “She received community service for shoplifting.”
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Life in prison:</strong> “The murderer was sentenced to life in prison.”</li>
                    <li><strong>House arrest:</strong> “The young offender stayed at home under house arrest.”
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These expressions illustrate the variety of consequences that crimes can have, from small penalties
                    to
                    very serious ones.
                </p>

                <h3>In addition, we often find this vocabulary in questions and commands used by the police. For
                    example:</h3>
                <p></p>
                <ul class="examples-list">
                    <li><strong>A criminal might ask:</strong> “What are my rights?” or “Can I call a lawyer?”</li>
                    <li><strong>A police officer might say:</strong> “You are under arrest” or “Please get in the
                        police car.”</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Finally, it is also useful to learn how this vocabulary appears in direct and reported speech:</h3>
                <p></p>
                <ul class="examples-list">
                    <li><strong>Direct:</strong> “A thief stole my purse.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Reported:</strong> “She said that a thief had stolen her purse.”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This shows that crime-related vocabulary is not only about words but also about how to use them in
                    different grammatical structures.

                    In conclusion, studying vocabulary about crime and punishment expands our English skills by giving
                    us
                    precise words for describing illegal actions, punishments, and legal contexts. It is a field that
                    connects language learning with real-life situations.

            <h2>Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
            <div class="content-container">
                <p>
                    In today’s world, mass media is everywhere: television, movies, newspapers, social media,
                    advertisements, and even video games. Because of this, it is essential to develop two key skills:
                    <strong>critical thinking</strong> and <strong>media literacy</strong>. These skills allow us not
                    only
                    to consume media but also to question, analyze, and understand the hidden messages behind what we
                    see and hear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Critical thinking</strong> is the ability to analyze information using observation,
                    experience,
                    reasoning, and logic. It goes beyond simply understanding the surface of a message. For example,
                    instead of just
                    believing a news story, a critical thinker might ask: Who wrote this article? What evidence supports
                    it?
                    Could there be another perspective? This mindset helps us identify implicit intentions, values, and
                    ideologies within media texts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Media literacy</strong> is the practical application of critical thinking to media. It means
                    “reading” media texts carefully to find underlying meanings. A media text is not only something
                    written but also
                    advertisements, songs, websites, or even billboards. For example:
                </p>

                <ul class="examples-list">
                    <li>An advertisement for perfume may <strong>use emotional appeal</strong>, suggesting that wearing
                        it will make someone feel luxurious.</li>
                    <li>Another ad might use <strong>celebrity endorsement</strong>, where a famous person promotes the
                        product to influence consumers.</li>
                    <li>A commercial may apply <strong>generalization</strong>, implying that “everyone uses this
                        product,” to persuade viewers.</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="critical.png" alt="Image related to Critical Thinking and Media Literacy">

                <p>
                    These strategies show how media is designed to attract attention, persuade, or sell, and media
                    literacy
                    gives us the tools to recognize these techniques instead of being unconsciously manipulated by them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important point is that <strong>objectivity in media does not exist</strong>. Every text or
                    story is presented from the perspective of its producer. Even documentaries or news reports are
                    influenced by the values,
                    culture, and interests of the creators. That is why asking questions like “What is the author’s
                    purpose?” or “How might different audiences interpret this message?” is crucial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a movie based on “true events” is still a version of the story shaped by the director’s
                    choices. Likewise, two different newspapers may report the same political event but present it with
                    very
                    different tones, depending on their ideology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, critical thinking and media literacy are not only academic concepts but essential
                    life
                    skills. They empower us to interpret messages independently, resist manipulation, and form our own
                    opinions. In a world full of media influences, these skills help us make informed decisions and
                    become
                    more responsible consumers of information.

                <p>
                    During my learning process, I have had the opportunity to practice English through various
                    activities
                    such as videos, audios, written documents, and creative projects. Each task allowed me to improve
                    specific skills: speaking in interviews and presentations, writing formal emails, creating brochures
                    and
                    mind maps, and analyzing academic topics such as Crime and Punishment, Critical Thinking, and Media
                    Literacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These experiences not only helped me expand my vocabulary and strengthen my grammar, but also gave
                    me
                    the confidence to communicate in English in academic and professional contexts. I realized that
                    learning
                    a language requires consistency, creativity, and reflection, and that every activity is a step
                    forward
                    in my personal and professional development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, this blog is the result of my effort and progress in English learning. It reflects
                    how I
                    have combined technology, creativity, and practice to build a stronger foundation in a second
                    language,
                    which will be very valuable for my future career.
